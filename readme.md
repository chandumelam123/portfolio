# Portfolio

This was my second project of udacity nano-degree programme.

It is a simple one page portfolio featuring responsive design using media queries,view port;

I wrote css code in a seperate file named port.css  to make html code more readable.

I used some css in html  file itself as it would make sense to include it in the  as inline css;
